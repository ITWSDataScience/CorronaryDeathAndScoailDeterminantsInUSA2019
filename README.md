#### About:

Coronary heart disease has become one of the major complications that ail the American population. 
So, in this paper, we investigate the factors that may be responsible for coronary heart disease in the United States.
We perform two types of analysis - an analysis of coronary heart disease and median household income for New York State and an analysis of coronary heart disease and social determinants for the entire United States.
We obtain public domain data from www.cdc.gov and www.data.gov to perform our analysis.
Our results show some significant relationships between social determinant factors and heart disease mortality rates.
Hopefully, this report will be able to coherently express these relationships to the concerned authorities so that they can use this a s a basis for further investigations in this field.
Since heart disease is one of the primary killers of the US population, such investigations may help increase the average lifespan of people across the country.
